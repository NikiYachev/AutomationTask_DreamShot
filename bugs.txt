1. The 'watch video' button does NOT work /Title/

Severity: Medium
Priority: High
Reproducibility: Every time

Summary: When pressing the 'watch' video button in the 'Mix 3D and 2D design with Framer' section, nothing happens. 

I could make a .HAR file, but on pressing the button, no request is executed. 
It seems there is no back-end code behind it.

2. The 'Sign Up' form does NOT work/Title/

Severity: Blocking
Priority: High
Reproducibility: Every time

Summary: I fill in the 'e-mail' and the 'password' fields with valid data, but on pressing the
'Sign Up' button I get an error message.

The message itself: "Please. include an '@' in the e_mail address. The {my password} is missing an '@'.

It seems that the 'password' field has the restrictions of an 'e-mail' field.
